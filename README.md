# Clubsaurus
Open source, self-hostable student org management. 

## Philosophy
This is based on the old version of [Clubsaurus](https://github.com/CoasterFan5/Clubsaurus-old), which I built in high school. However, due to how that version was built, I felt trapped, and it didn't feel ready for the enterprise-level use that education institutions require. 

Edtech often does not consider education's best interests but instead focuses on sales and marketing. I hope Clubsaurus can be different.
